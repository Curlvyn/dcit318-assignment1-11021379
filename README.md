**Student ID:** 11021379

### 📘 Description
This project consists of three separate C# console applications that demonstrate the use of conditional logic, user input, and exception handling.


### 📂 Applications

#### 1. 🎓 Grade Calculator
- Prompts user to input a numerical grade (supports decimal values).
- Outputs a corresponding letter grade (A–F).
- Includes input validation and loop for continuous use.

#### 2. 🎟️ Ticket Price Calculator

- Applies discount pricing for children (≤12) and senior citizens (≥65).
- Rejects negative ages with proper validation and exception handling.

#### 3. 🔺 Triangle Type Identifier
- Prompts user to enter the lengths of three triangle sides.
- Identifies the triangle as **Equilateral**, **Isosceles**, or **Scalene**.
- Ignores invalid triangle side combinations (no output if not valid).
